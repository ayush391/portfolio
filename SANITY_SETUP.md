## Deploying Sanity Studio

Once you're ready to deploy the Studio to Sanity's servers:

```bash
pnpm run sanity-deploy
```

This will give you a URL like: `https://your-project.sanity.studio`

## Next Steps

After setting up all your content in Sanity Studio, the next phase will involve:
1. Updating the frontend components to fetch data from Sanity
2. Creating dynamic routes for projects
3. Testing the integration
4. Deploying to production

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't access Studio**: Make sure environment variables are set correctly
- **Missing schemas**: Clear `.next` folder and restart dev server
- **Images not loading**: Ensure images are uploaded to Sanity, not using local paths
